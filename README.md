# Final Project for UCLA Math 156




### Topic: Stock (Closing) Price Predicting (of AAPL) using Machine Learning Techniques

Motivation: Stock price prediction is a classic, important, and difficult problem. With a successful model to predict stock prices, one can gain insight into market behavior and discover trends that otherwise would have been unnoticed. Additionally, being able to accurately predict stock prices will allow one to receive generous gains from investing in the market, but this is a challenging task. 

Therefore, analyzing historical stock price data is important for uncovering meaningful conclusions and in this project, we are interested in predicting the stock price of Apple using various machine learning methods.

Preliminary Plan: We will apply deep learning artificial recurrent neural networks to this problem, specifically the Long Short-Term Memory method, to forecast Appleâ€™s stock values using historical data. We will begin by processing the data set to ensure that it is ready for LSTM, then we will analyze the loss and accuracy of our model and compare it with real data.
